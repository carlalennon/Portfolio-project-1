# Dublin Animation Meetup Website Project


## Client Goals 
Dublin Animation Meetup is a meetup group for animation professionals in the city center. What started as a pint with friends has grown into a monthly event with over 100 attendees. With such a big operation, DAM finds itself needing a place to collect emails, announce upcoming events, and showcase the art created for the event. It was decided that a website would meet these needs. 

## Purpose of Site
DAM needed a site that people could go to when asked about the event. Until now, the main contact point for DAM was an Instagram page. However, this poses several problems. The first is that not everyone uses Instagram. As DAM attracts a wider client base through word of mouth in studios, the clientele grows to include people who are older, or generally not on social media. 

The second problem is that using a social media platform to cultivate an audience means that the group does not necessarily own that audience. The group is at the mercy of the platform that it is hosted on. Should the platform decided the content is inappropriate, violates copyright or does not comply with their terms, the account could be terminated and the main contact point with the customer is lost. 

The third is that, even when kept in good standing with the platform, the organisation's message may not be put in front of the intended audience. A creator cannot ensure that their content will be shown to their followers on any social media platform. With the rise of algorithmically driven content curation, the meetup group would have to play the "algorithm game" in order to push content to their followers. While this may work for content creators who post in mulitiple ways, many times per day, this does not suit a meetup group which posts only once per month.

The solution to the above issues it to create a landing site that anyone can access without a social media account, and that can collect emails so that updates can be delivered directly into the inboxes of those who would like to see them. 

## Value Provided to User
DAM's website was designed with the user's experience in mind. It is easy to navigate, and provides information about the event. Users can navigate here to find out when the next event is being held, view the artwork produced for past events, and sign up to the newsletter to keep in touch with the organisation's progress and upcoming events. 

## Features

 ### Navigation
 The navigation menu is designed to be easily read and used by any user. The header is in the offical DAM teal colour with the organisation's name in large font on the top.

 For ease of use and to help orient the user, the active page that they are viewing becomes underlined in the navigation bar.

 ### Footer
 The footer is also in the official teal colour, and contains navigation links to the external DAM platforms. It also contains a copyright notice, a feature I noticed wa common on other similar websites.

 ### Home page
 Thehomepage features a cover image of Dublin City, and the bar that the event is hosted in. Is also features a short blurb about the organisation, and a button with a call to action that takes the user to the signup page.

 ### Biography
 The biography section adds some portraits and information about the founders of DAM. In order to keep the portraits a good size, it shifts to a vertical layout on phones and tablets.

 There are also links to each of the founders social medias and portfolios underneath the portraits. They are laid out as icons to make them as easy as possible to tap on mobile and smaller screens.

 ### Past Poster Gallery 
 A gallery has been made to showcase the posters generously made by fans and attendees of DAM. The bautiful artwork is subject to major compression on the Instagram app, and the group sorely needed a place to showcase the art in a larger format. The gallery provides a space to do this. The gallery includes space to add further posters in the future.

 ### Signup Form
 This website contains a signup form for people interested in signing up for the DAM newletter. The newsletter collector requires a name and an email address. 

## Design Philosophy
Dublin Animation Meetup has an established branding, which must be incorporated into the website build. The offical hex code for "DAM blue" is used for the header and footer. The logo is simply the organisation's name in the Adobe font of "Canvas Script 1". This colour and font combination appears in all the print media and banner for the organisation. For this reason, the script font was used in headers and titles for the website in order to keep the branding cohesive. DAM is primarily a service for "digital natives", i.e. young professionals from 21-35. The look of the site was kept clean and fresh in line with the look of "big five" social media platforms. The Aria font family provides a clean and easily legible font solution. 

## Show Your Work
The resources I used to learn CSS and understand concepts delivered in the course. 

- Web3 schools was in invaluable recource for both CSS and html development in this project. Careful study of the materials provided there was the backbone of this project.
- Github forums was another resource, very valuable for troubleshooting random bugs and problems loading CSS on Github pages.
- Mentor Sheryl, bug extra thanks to her for seeing into the Matrix and identifying what went wrong on bigs that had me stumped, and patiently answering my endless barrage of questions. 
- Digital Ocean for help with markdown. 

## Future Features

### Gallery Expansion
I would like to add a feature that the items in the poster gallery could be clicked on, bringing the user to a new page with a full resolution version of the poster. This page would feature information about the art's development, with the name of the creator and a link to their social media. 

### Sitemap
As the site grows, I would like to add a sitemap link in the footer, bringing the user to a page with all the links laid out. As the site is only 4 pages for now, the sitemap is unessecary. However in the future, with an extended gallery planned, it would be handy for artists looking for their particular art and information to be able to access that from a single plage without having to navigate to the gallery, and then finding their poster on the gallery page. 

## Errors and Bugs
- The signup form was built to push to a Google doc, but at the moment only throws an error. I'll have to come back and resolve this later, as I belive the problem may be linked to the fact that the site is hosted locally. An alternative would be to simply embed a Google form, but I wanted to build a form for grading purposes.
